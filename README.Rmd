# COCA: Combination Dose Optimization and Component Contribution Assessment

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This work introduces **COCA**, a two-stage randomized phase II design that seamlessly integrates combination dose optimization with component contribution assessment. In stage 1, the optimal combination dose is determined by maximizing the riskâ€“benefit tradeoff across multiple candidate combination doses. In stage 2, a multi-arm randomized phase is initiated to evaluate the contribution of each component within the combination therapy.

## Installation
JAGS is required for implementing Bayesian MCMC sampling. Please download JAGS from https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/. 

To install the COCA package from GitHub, run:
``` r
remotes::install_github("XXX")
```

## Usage

Get the calibrated design cutoffs and stage 1 sample size:

```{r example1}
# library(COCA)
## basic example code
```

Run simulation to get the operating characteristics of the COCA design with the calibrated configurations:

```{r example2}
# library(COCA)
## basic example code
```
