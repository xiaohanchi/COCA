# COCA: Combination Dose Optimization and Component Contribution Assessment

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

### Overview

**COCA** is a two-stage randomized phase II design that seamlessly integrates combination dose optimization with component contribution assessment. In stage 1, the optimal combination dose is determined by maximizing the riskâ€“benefit tradeoff across multiple candidate combination doses. In stage 2, a multi-arm randomized phase is initiated to evaluate the contribution of each component within the combination therapy.

### Installation

To install the COCA package from GitHub, run:

``` r
if (!require("devtools")) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("xiaohanchi/COCA")
```

### Usage

Load COCA package:

```{r load, eval = FALSE}
library(COCA)
```

For a specific stage 2 sample size (e.g., 20), get the calibrated design cutoffs and power:

```{r example1, eval = FALSE}
COCA.calibration(
  case = 1, n.stage1 = 24, n.stage2 = 20, dosage.singleA = 300, dosage.singleB = 300, 
  dosage.comb = list(A = c(300, 300, 200), B = c(300, 200, 300)),
  eff.null = 0.25, eff.alt.SOC = 0.25, eff.alt.A = 0.35, 
  eff.alt.B = 0.35, eff.alt.AB = 0.55, period.effect = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3), 
  alpha.level = 0.10, alpha.max = 0.20, fsr.level = 0.05, tsr.level = 0.80, n.simu = 100
)
```

-   `n.simu` is set to 100 for illustration. For more accurate calibration, consider using a larger value, such as 10000, though this may require additional computation time.
-   If the power does not reach the target, increase `n.stage2` and repeat the process.

Once the optimal `n.stage2` is found, run simulations to get the operating characteristics of the COCA design with the calibrated configurations:

```{r example2, eval = FALSE}
# E.g., scenario 1 (period effect = 0)
COCA.getOC(
  case = 1, n.stage1 = 24, n.stage2 = 26, Ce = 0.8983, c0 = 0.7, 
  dosage.ctrl = c(A = 0, B = 0), dosage.singleA = 300, dosage.singleB = 300,
  dosage.comb = list(A = c(300, 300, 200), B = c(300, 200, 300)),
  tox.SOC = 0.10, eff.SOC = 0.25, tox.A = 0.25, tox.B = 0.15, 
  eff.A = 0.25, eff.B = 0.25, tox.AB = c(0.30, 0.30, 0.15), 
  eff.AB.s1 = c(0.25, 0.25, 0.25), eff.AB.s2 = c(0.25, 0.25, 0.25), n.simu = 100
)
```

-   Again, `n.simu` is set to 100 for illustration. For more accurate simulation, consider using a larger value, such as 10000.

### Examples: Redesigning the NCT02519348 Trial

This example provides a step-by-step tutorial on redesigning the NCT02519348 trial<sup>[2]</sup> using COCA. This trial involves four arms: T 300 mg $\times$ 1 dose plus D 1500 mg (T300+D), T 75 mg $\times$ 4 doses plus D 1500 mg (T75+D), D 1500 mg monotherapy, and T 750mg monotherapy.

##### 1. Preparation

To get started, we need to specify the appropriate input arguments. Since this trial lacks a control arm, we assume the T monotherapy arm as the standard of care (SOC) control for illustration. Therefore, this trial falls into `case = 2` (S0C(A) vs. B vs AB). We use the log scale dosage as the dosage input for each arm:

``` r
dosage.ctrl = c(A = log(750), B = 0)
dosage.singleA = 0 #Set to zero since single agent A is considered as the control arm
dosage.singleB = log(1500) 
dosage.comb = list(A = c(log(300), log(75)), B = c(log(1500), log(1500)))
```

The null hypothesis is $H_0: q_{21}=q_{22}=q_{23}=0.07$, so `eff.null = 0.07`. The alternative hypothesis is $H_1: q_{21}=0.07, q_{22}=0.12, q_{23}=0.25$, so:

``` r
eff.alt.SOC = 0.07
eff.alt.B = 0.12
eff.alt.AB = 0.25
```

We also hope to control the maximum type I error under potential period effects within the range of 0 to 0.1, so we specify `period.effect = seq(0, 0.1, 0.02)`. For other configurations, please refer to Section 5 of [1]. With all these arguments in place, we can proceed to calibrate our design parameters.

##### 2. Calibration

The `COCA.calibration` function will output the corresponding power and design cutoffs ($C_{e1}$ and $c_0$). If the target FSR and TSR levels are not met with the current settings, `COCA.calibration` will return $c_0=-1$ and issue a warning suggesting an increase in the stage 2 sample size. We would like to search for the optimal stage 2 sample size, starting from 30, until the target power (`output$Power`) and success rate (`output$c0`) are achieved:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
power.target <- 0.90
n.stage2 <- 30
search.step <- 2
while(output$Power < power.target | output$c0 == -1){
  output <- COCA.calibration(
    case = 2, n.stage1 = 24, n.stage2 = n.stage2, 
    dosage.ctrl = c(A = log(750), B = 0), dosage.singleA = 0, dosage.singleB = log(1500), 
    dosage.comb = list(A = c(log(300), log(75)), B = c(log(1500), log(1500))),
    eff.null = 0.07, eff.alt.SOC = 0.07, eff.alt.B = 0.12, eff.alt.AB = 0.25, 
    period.effect = seq(0, 0.1, 0.02), alpha.level = 0.10, alpha.max = 0.20, 
    fsr.level = 0.05, tsr.level = 0.80, n.simu = 10000
  )
  n.stage2 <- n.stage2 + search.step
}

output
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
display.output <- tibble(
  case = 2, n.stage2 = 38, Ce1 = 0.7710, c0 = 0.84, Power = 0.9138, TypeI = 0.100
)
display.output
```
This code may take a while to run... (Note: In my own implementation, I used high-performance computing clusters and parallel computing to accelerate the process.) For illustration, consider using a smaller number of replicates (e.g., `n.simu = 100`). Once completed, we obtained the optimal stage 2 sample size of 38, along with design cutoffs $C_{e1}=0.7710$ and $c_0=0.84$, as reported in our paper.
