# COCA: Combination Dose Optimization and Component Contribution Assessment

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This work introduces **COCA**, a two-stage randomized phase II design
that seamlessly integrates combination dose optimization with component
contribution assessment. In stage 1, the optimal combination dose is
determined by maximizing the riskâ€“benefit tradeoff across multiple
candidate combination doses. In stage 2, a multi-arm randomized phase is
initiated to evaluate the contribution of each component within the
combination therapy.

## Installation

JAGS is required for implementing Bayesian MCMC sampling. Please
download JAGS from <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/>.

To install the COCA package from GitHub, run:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("xiaohanchi/COCA")
```

## Usage

Get the calibrated design cutoffs and stage 1 sample size:

``` r
# library(COCA)
## basic example code
```

Run simulation to get the operating characteristics of the COCA design
with the calibrated configurations:

``` r
# library(COCA)
## basic example code
```
