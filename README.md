# COCA: Combination Dose Optimization and Component Contribution Assessment

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This work introduces **COCA**, a two-stage randomized phase II design
that seamlessly integrates combination dose optimization with component
contribution assessment. In stage 1, the optimal combination dose is
determined by maximizing the riskâ€“benefit tradeoff across multiple
candidate combination doses. In stage 2, a multi-arm randomized phase is
initiated to evaluate the contribution of each component within the
combination therapy.

## Installation

JAGS is required for implementing Bayesian MCMC sampling. Please
download JAGS from <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/>.

To install the COCA package from GitHub, run:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("xiaohanchi/COCA")
```

## Usage

Load COCA package:

``` r
library(COCA)
```

For a specific stage 2 sample size (e.g., 20), get the calibrated design
cutoffs and power:

``` r
COCA.calibration(
  case = 1, n.stage1 = 24, n.stage2 = 20, eff.null = 0.25,
  eff.alt.SOC = 0.25, eff.alt.A = 0.35, eff.alt.B = 0.35, eff.alt.AB = 0.55,
  period.effect = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3),
  alpha.level = 0.10, alpha.max = 0.20, fsr.level = 0.05, tsr.level = 0.80, 
  n.simu = 100
)
```

- `n.simu` is set to 100 for illustration. For more accurate
  calibration, consider using a larger value, such as 10000, though this
  may require additional computation time.
- If the power does not reach the target, increase `n.stage2` and repeat
  the process.

Once the optimal `n.stage2` is found, run simulations to get the
operating characteristics of the COCA design with the calibrated
configurations:

``` r
# E.g., scenario 1 (period effect = 0)
COCA.getOC(
  n.stage2 = 26, Ce = 0.8983, c0 = 0.7,
  tox.SOC = 0.10, eff.SOC = 0.25,
  tox.A = 0.25, tox.B = 0.15,
  eff.A = 0.25, eff.B = 0.25,
  tox.AB = c(0.30, 0.30, 0.15), eff.AB = c(0.25, 0.25, 0.25),
  period.effect = 0, n.simu = 100
)
```

- Again, `n.simu` is set to 100 for illustration. For more accurate
  simulation, consider using a larger value, such as 10000.
